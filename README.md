# First-2D-game

This is the first game I did by following the Godot documentation which can be found on their official website.

I created the main music some years ago on Bandlab (you can check it here https://www.bandlab.com/post/9e511242-ffa5-eb11-85aa-0050f28a50ba).

It was pretty fun.

Next I'll be working on something bigger
